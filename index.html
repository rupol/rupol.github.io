              I built this implementation of John Conway's classic
              cellular-automaton, zero player game during the Computer Science
              portion of my time at Lambda School. The game was built in React
              and styled using reactstrap. The game grid is created and animated
              using canvas with random colors, which was tricky to do with
              React, but was fun to figure out.

              This product is the culmination of my Lambda School Labs
              experience, an extended group collaboration of 7 Software
              Engineers and 1 Data Scientist. I worked across both front and
              backend, implementing db architecture, authentication, and MapBox.
              This project was a real joy to work on, I had such a great team
              and learned a ton of exciting new technologies.

              I have a background in Conservation Biology, so I was very excited
              to create this conservation fundraising and networking app during
              two separate "build weeks" at Lambda School. I built this project
              from the ground up to create a React web app with Redux state
              management, and corresponding RESTful API using Node.js and
              Postgres.

              site to align with modern accessibility practices and web
              standards to serve as our new best-practices standard at Wax. I
              utilized SCSS to create DRY styling, and implemented custom fields
              and php scripting to optimize maintainability through WordPress.

              Water My Plants was a project that came out of a "build week" at
              Lambda School. I worked with two other React developers to create
              this fully responsive single page app with components, events, and
              hooks. My focus was on the "My Plants" and "Profile" pages, as
              well as on styling using material-ui.

              It's embarrasing to admit this, but this was one of the first apps
              I wanted to make when I started coding. Monk is my comfort show,
              and anytime I'm traveling I turn on the hotel room TV hoping to
              catch a random episode or two. I created this React app using the

                target="_blank"

              created the entire marketing page, including the identity and
              responsive sidenav.
