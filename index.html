            <h3>Key Conservation</h3>
            <p>
              I have a background in Conservation Biology, so I was very excited
              to create this app during a "build week" at Lambda School. I was
              the only React developer on my team, though I worked with a team
              of front end developers who built out a marketing page. I created
              this app from the ground up, utilizing CRUD operations to interact
              with the back end, and Redux for state management.

              I was the lead developer on this project and rebuilt our company
              site to align with modern accessibility practices and web
              standards to serve as our new best-practices standard at Wax. I
              utilized SCSS to create DRY styling, and implemented custom fields
              and php scripting to optimize maintainability through WordPress.

            <p>
              Water My Plants was a project that came out of a "build week" at
              Lambda School. I worked with two other React developers to create
              this fully responsive single page app with components, events, and
              hooks. My focus was on the "My Plants" and "Profile" pages, as
              well as on styling using material-ui.

              It's embarrasing to admit this, but this was one of the first apps
              I wanted to make when I started coding. Monk is my comfort show,
              and anytime I'm traveling I turn on the hotel room TV hoping to
              catch a random episode or two. I created this React app using the
              <a

                target="_blank"

              Guidr was the result of a "build week" collaboration with two
              classmates at Lambda School. Guidr is an app that helps
              backcountry guides share their private and professional trips. I
              created the entire marketing page, including the identity and
              responsive sidenav.

              I designed and created the flexbox framework and html markup for

              to send out their save the dates in time.

              <a href="http://miktwar.com/">Mikhail Twarogowski</a>, who did the
              design work, and my first collaboration carried out using GitHub.
              This was my first full flexbox site. I also utilized a Google Form
              and styled it so it responsively scaled with the page.
