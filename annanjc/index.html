            Fun with friends on the shortest night of the year!
          </h2>
          <p>
            Come join us for a weekend of camping and fun on the shortest night
            of the year! The solstice is a time for reflection and mindfulness,
            and what better way to mark the passage of time than spending it
            outdoors with friends.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a fun night spent around the bonfire in our backyard this past
            winter solstice, we decided that we needed to do something similar
            for the summer solstice. Inspired by an annual 'pig roast' campout
            some friends of friends used to do, and our wedding spent with
            friends and family in a big group site near Twin Lakes, we decided
            to book a campsite to share with friends and usher in summertime
            fun! We're hoping to make this a yearly tradition, so if there's a
            place you know of that would be awesome to go next year, let's do
            it.

            Pickle Gulch is an area that offers day-use picnic sites and six
            campsites to accommodate large groups. The picnic site can
            accommodate up to 150 people and is equipped with picnic tables and
            campfire circles. A parking area, vault toilets and a playground are
            provided. The group campsites are all walk-to sites for tent camping
            only. The on-site host has wheelbarrows available for campers, to
            haul equipment from the parking area. Each campsite is equipped with
            picnic tables, a campfire circle and tent pads. Vault toilets and
            drinking water spigots are shared between sites. A separate day-use
            area contains two volleyball courts, horseshoe pits, picnic tables
            and a vault toilet. Firewood may be gathered from the surrounding
            forest, if available, or purchased from the host.
            <br /><br />
            The site offers many scenic views of the surrounding area. It is set
            among a fairly level forest of lodgepole pine trees, dotted with
            aspens. Due to the mountain pine beetle infestation and removal of
            hazardous trees, there may be little to no shade at these sites.

            Colorado weather is notoriously fickle. While it should be sunny and
            warm, it can snow any time of year up here, so it is always a good
            idea to be prepared for any temperature. If you're new to camping,
            make sure you bring clothes that are comfy and warm with layers to
            shed if it decides to be 80 degrees.
